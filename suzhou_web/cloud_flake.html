A few days before the festival, no one does not buy cloud cake, in addition to their own use, he also gave.

All kinds of raw materials are processed properly, mixed and mixed, compressed. Finally, the slicer holds a sharp and generous knife and cuts it into pieces, as thin as a page. When you unseal a piece of cloud cake like a book in the 16th grade, you will be amazed by its white color and fragrant smell.</p>

                    <p>Whenver there was a wedding, </p><div id="p1">I always got these cloud flake cake as a gift. </div><p>I was a kid when I first tasted them. They are soft and sweet.

                    <p> I almost didn't feel anything going through my teeth when I first bit it. It is so thin yet so flavourful. I was satisfied to hear </p><div id="p3">the friction between the cake and my teeth</div>.
                    </p>
                    <p>I always wondered why the name for them is cloud flake cake. Now I'm thinking about it: the cake is as light as the cloud and the color is as pure as the cloud. It's cut in thin pieces like </p><div id="p4">snow flakes</div>.
                    <p>The sesame seeds embedded in the cake is the best part. They crunch in between my teeth and they left my mouth with a special scent of the seeds. I can't get enough of them.</p>
                    <p>I think of </p><div id="p5">my grandma</div> <p>when I look at these pictures and trying to come up with food in my hometown. I haven't been back for such a long time and all my memories are blurry. Yet I still remember my grandma's smiley face :) and when she handed my the flake cake.</p>
